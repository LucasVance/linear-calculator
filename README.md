# Linear Calculator

This repository is a collection of Python scripts that find different properties of linear equations.

## How to use
To use these scripts, you will need to clone this repository in your CLI and run `main.py` with Python.

1. Clone this git repository in your environment by using
`git clone https://github.com/LucasVance/linear-calculator`

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Run `main.py` with Python by using `python3 main.py`.

4. The script will ask what property you would like to find, and input one of the scripts below. Then, enter two sets of (x, y) coordinates, and the answer should be outputted.

## Scripts
### Slope (`slope.py`)
A slope calculator that returns slope as a fraction (kind of) or as "undefined" or 0.

### Distance (`distance.py`)
Calculates the distance between two 2D points that rounds to a number with two-digit points.

### Midpoint (`midpoint.py`)
Calculates the midpoint of two 2D points.
