## Slope calculator (slope.py)
A simple slope calculator that returns slope as a fraction (kind of) or as "undefined" or 0.

Step 1: Run the script using Python. WOW!  
Step 2: Type in coordinates!  
Step 3: Type in MORE coordinates!  
Step 4: Use your READING SKILLS and your BRAIN (maybe) to find the slope!  
Step 5: i dont have another step  

## Distance calculator (distance.py)
Calculates the distance between two 2D points that rounds to a number with two-digit points.

## Midpoint calculator (midpoint.py)
Calculates the midpoint of two 2D points.
